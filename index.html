<p>This project provides assets for utilizing the Cockatrice game application to enable playing Blizzard's game Hearthstone.</p>

<h2>
<a name="setting-up" class="anchor" href="#setting-up"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Setting up</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download and install Cockatrice from <a href="http://woogerworks.com/">Woogerworks</a>.</li>
<li>Clone this repository to a folder of your choosing.</li>
<li>Open the Cockatrice settings. The following paths are relative to the folder containing the cloned repo.

<ul>
<li>Change the picture directory to point to the /pics folder.</li>
<li>Change the card database path to /db/cards.xml, and the token database path to /db/tokens.xml</li>
<li>Optionally, change the card back to /card_back.jpg</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connect to the woogerworks server to play. (Note that Cockatrice is intended for playing Magic: the Gathering. Arrange games with friends through other means of communication.)</li>
</ol><p>Instead of cloning the repository you can always choose to just download the repository as a zip. However, cloning the repository lets you retrive any updates easily.</p>

<p>It might be the case that you use Cockatrice to play Magic as well. In that situation application virtualization could be the solution. There are multiple options to choose from, but one suggestion (for windows) would be <a href="http://www.sandboxie.com/">Sandboxie</a>. Instructions for setting up application virtualization is outside the scope of this readme.    </p>

<a name="additional-assets" class="anchor" href="#additional-assets"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional assets</h2>

<p>A basic deck template for each class is provided under the /deck_templates folder. These templates are preset with a sideboard containing the hero card and any hero specific cards.  </p>

<h2>
<a name="best-practices" class="anchor" href="#best-practices"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Best practices</h2>

<p>Cockatrice is intended for playing Magic: the Gathering, but with some adoptions it can house sessions of Hearthstone play.</p>

<ul>
<li>The sideboard (shown with Ctrl+F3) is used to hold the hero card, hero specific cards, a Mana Crystal and The Coin, as well as any token cards for the deck.</li>
<li>If you create token through the token dialog, always uncheck the destroy token checkbox since the cards may need to be picked up to your hand. Note that cloning cards (with Ctrl+J) always creates tokens that are destroyed when leaving the playing field.</li>
<li>Use the Mana Crystal from the sideboard (and clones thereof) to track your mana. Tap the crystals to mark how much mana you have used that turn.

<ul>
<li>When playing as Shaman, move crystals further apart to mark overloaded mana and tap them, starting with the rightmost crystal, to mark overloaded mana on a turn when you have mana already locked.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mark the current hp of minions with red counters. Always track the current hp rather than damage taken.</li>
<li>Track armor with yellow counters on the hero card.</li>
<li>When using the die to randomly choose a character and/or minion assign numbers in this order (for those applicable). The first number is your opponent, then the opponent's minions, your own minions, and last yourself as the last number.</li>
<li>To perform "random card from deck" effects, use the View library feature, count the number of creatures and roll a die.<br>
</li>
<li>To perform "random card from opponent's deck" effects, use the "Show library to other player" feature. The opponent then creates a token of two cards.</li>
<li>Playing or moving a card secretly, e.g. when playing Secret cards, can be done by dragging the card while holding down shift. This places the card face down. You can peak at the card by selecting "Peak at card face" in the card's context menu (then press the card in the chat to see the card picture).</li>
