# hearthstone-cockatrice

This project provides assets for utilizing the Cockatrice game application to
enable playing Blizzard's game Hearthstone.

## Setting up

There are two ways of download the assets. You can either download an archive
of the repository, or you can clone the repository. The advantage of cloning
is that you can retrieve updates to the assets easily.

1. Download and install Cockatrice from [Woogerworks](http://woogerworks.com/).
1. Clone this repository, or extract the archive, to a folder of your choosing.
1. Open the Cockatrice settings. The following paths are relative to the folder
   containing the cloned repo.
  - Change the picture directory to point to the /pics folder.
  - Change the card database path to /db/cards.xml, and the token database path
    to /db/tokens.xml
  - Optionally, select a card back from the selection available in the
    /card_backs directory.
1. Connect to the woogerworks server to play. (Note that Cockatrice is intended
   for playing Magic: the Gathering. Arrange games with friends through other
   means of communication.)

It might be the case that you use Cockatrice to play Magic as well. On Windows
this will mix the settings from Magic and the Hearthstone port even if you have
installed it in two places since the settings are stored in the registry. In
this situation application virtualization could be used. There are multiple
options to choose from, but one suggestion would be [Sandboxie][virt].
Instructions for setting up application virtualization is outside the scope of
this readme.

## Additional assets

A basic deck template for each class is provided under the /deck_templates
folder. These templates are preset with a sideboard containing the hero card
and any hero specific cards.  

## Best practices

Cockatrice is intended for playing Magic: the Gathering, but with some
adoptions it can house sessions of Hearthstone play.

- The sideboard (shown with Ctrl+F3) is used to hold the hero card, hero
  specific cards, a Mana Crystal and The Coin, as well as any token cards for
  the deck.
- If you create token through the token dialog, always uncheck the destroy
  token checkbox since the cards may need to be picked up to your hand. Note
  that cloning cards (with Ctrl+J) always creates tokens that are destroyed
  when leaving the playing field.
- Use the Mana Crystal from the sideboard (and clones thereof) to track your
  mana. Tap the crystals to mark how much mana you have used that turn.
  - When playing as Shaman, move crystals further apart to mark overloaded mana
    and tap them, starting with the rightmost crystal, to mark overloaded mana
	on a turn when you have mana already locked.
- Mark the current hp of minions with red counters. Always track the current hp
  rather than damage taken.
- Track armor with yellow counters on the hero card.
- When using the die to randomly choose a character and/or minion assign
  numbers in this order (for those applicable). The first number is your
  opponent, then the opponent's minions, your own minions, and last yourself as
  the last number.
- To perform "random card from deck" effects, use the View library feature,
  count the number of creatures and roll a die.  
- To perform "random card from opponent's deck" effects, use the "Show library
  to other player" feature. The opponent then creates a token of two cards.
- Playing or moving a card secretly, e.g. when playing Secret cards, can be
  done by dragging the card while holding down shift. This places the card face
  down. You can peak at the card by selecting "Peak at card face" in the card's
  context menu (then press the card in the chat to see the card picture).
