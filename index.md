# Welcome

Are you playing Hearthstone, Blizzard Entertainment's popular online card game,
but don't have all those fancy legendary dudes to play around with? Or you 
have them but you want a calmer setting to practice your decks with friends?

If so, this is the place for you. This project provides all the assets,
graphics and data files, needed to play Hearthstone using the Cockatrice
application which is available from [Woogerworks](http://woogerworks.com/).

However, note that Cockatrice is meant for playing the card game Magic the
Gathering so don't use the Cockatrice chat system to talk about, or find
players for Hearthstone. Also, do not allow game spectators that are not using
this Hearstone port.

# How to use this

The simplest way to get the assets is to download the project as an archive
from this site. However, cloning the [github repo][repo] has the advantage of
easily getting access to future updates by simply pulling the latest revision.

The exact installation instructions are available in the readme file in the
github repository. The readme also has advice, or best practices, for how to
simulate Hearthstone specific mechanics in Cockatrice.

# Screenshots

How does this look in practice. Here are two examples:

port is a continuation.

Further thanks to [Hearthhead](http://hearthhead.com/) which I have used as my
